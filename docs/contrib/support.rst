Mailing List
------------

The mailing list is one of our best resources for development because that's the place where we make all discussions about the project.

Do I need to be a developer to join in?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

No, you don't need to be a developer to join in. Although we discuss technical issues, the main goal is try to keep you up to date about the progress of development, give you hints about new features and let you know when start the test phases.

How often do you post on that list?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Not so much, is a low traffic list. We are pretty much objective ;)

Which are the rules for post?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are no explicit rules in this list beyond common sense. What we love more is mutual respect, `netiquette <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_(technology)>`_ and english. Some of us speak spanish, others italian, even german but english is the language that fits for all, it lets us interact and post in a smooth way.

So, where do I sign in?
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Well, first we need your credit card number and the four digi... Nah, just kidding :)
